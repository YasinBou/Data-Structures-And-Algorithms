# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is a personal collection of algorithms and data structure implementations written in Java. The goal is to revisit and strengthen my understanding of foundational computer science concepts through hands-on coding.

It includes custom implementations of common data structures and related unit tests to validate their behavior. Over time, more structures and algorithms will be added.

This project is part of a broader effort to revisit foundational computer science concepts through hands-on coding.
